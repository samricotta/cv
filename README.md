I have experience working professionally as an engineer, a product owner, and a project manager. Specifically, I have 3 years of engineering experience, working in Golang, Ruby and with container technologies like Kubernetes and Docker. I also have 10 years of prior experience working as a project manager in event software, finance and politics. I feel stagnant in my current role and am looking for a new challenge. I am deeply committed to applying myself to whatever learning curve may be required for the job, and am eager to prove myself as a reliable and driven team-member.
