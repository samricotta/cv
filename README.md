Currently, I work as a Rails developer on our internal applications, implementing new features, such as automation of manual tasks otherwise done by customer support, and codebase maintenance. Additionally, I design solutions that optimise our current architecture. Recently, I have also taken over the responsibilities of the Product Owner and Scrum Master due to restructuring of teams. These responsibilities include the sprint plannings (both tech and product), backlog grooming, stakeholder reviews, and retrospectives. I work across both monolithic and microservice production environments using containerisation technologies, such as Kubernetes and Docker.
